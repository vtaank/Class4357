I2C bus.


If clk (SCLK) is high, data (SDA) is stable. If clk is low, ignore the data

Master controlls the clk. Master decides if slave needs to read or write. 

default data bus is pullup. Master does nothing. If transmit 1, Slave does no action. If transmit 0, slave pulls down.


I2C read:


Cortex M family (no ROM code??):

the compiled code, each 4 bytes stores some specific information. Some are reserved and software can store custom data there like CRC of binary.
first 4 bytes - Stack Pointer
second 4 bytes - Reset Handler
